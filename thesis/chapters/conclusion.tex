\section{Conclusions}

We presented some simple, artificial mutator which allowed use to illustrate some special garbage collector behavior. We have presented our tool chain to obtain a realistic \JS heap model. We have also extended existing work on empirical \JS heap analysis of real-world web applications with object size and heap structure distributions. We showed that the behavior of system objects is in some cases similar to the behavior of mutator objects. These results of the dependency of objects of type hidden and user-defined objects. At the end compared system objects and mutator objects. We illustrated the influence of Google's \JS virtual machine, V8, on the heap structure distributions.
