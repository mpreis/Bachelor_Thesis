\section{Conclusions}

We presented our analysis of popular and \JS-intensive real-world web
applications to obtain realistic distributions of object properties and heap
structure properties. Our analysis support developers by implementing realistic
\JS benchmarking suites which are able to simulate a realistic \JS heap
behavior. Such benchmarks will help to improve performance of memory management
systems of \JS virtual machines. Furthermore, this may improve the
performance of a \JS virtual machine in general.
