\begin{abstract}
	We present our tool chain to obtain a realistic \JS heap model. 
	We also present our analysis results of \JS heaps of real-world web applications. 
	These analysis results can be used as base for implementing benchmarks which are 
	able to simulate a realistic \JS heap behavior.
	Furthermore, we illustrate the overhead of Google's virtual machine, V8. 
	We analyze the overhead of the V8 separate and present the distributions of system objects and distinguish by types.
	At the end we compare system objects with mutator objects for better illustration of the overhead.
