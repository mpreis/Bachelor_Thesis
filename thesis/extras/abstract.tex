    \JS performance is a hot topic for pushing the boundaries of web
    applications.  Today, browser vendors compare to each other mainly on \JS
    benchmark scores rather than other web browsing features. However, recent
    studies~\cite{JSMeter2009} suggest that popular benchmarking suites do not
    reflect the behavior of real web applications.  We present an extensive
    analysis of \JS heaps in 11 real-world web applications to aid the
    development of more realistic workloads for benchmarking the memory
    management of \JS virtual machines. In this thesis, we confirm empirical
    results on object type and object lifetime distribution~\cite{JSMeter2009}
    and contribute new insights on object size distribution as well as heap
    structure properties. TODO: eventuall kannst du hier noch einen Satz anbringen
    der die Ergebnisse beschreibt. Aber nicht mehr als ein Satz. Sowas wie:
    Our results suggest that \JS applications typically allocate mostly
    small and short living objects and that blablabla is more likely than bla.

%Improving the performance of a \JS virtual machines is a hot topic. There are
%industry-standard benchmark suites to support implementation and optimization
%of \JS virtual machines, but studies, like \cite{JSMeter2009}, illustrate that
%these benchmarks do not represent a real-world web application behavior. Since
%\JS is a garbage collected programming language improving performance of the
%memory management of a \JS virtual machine may improve performance in general.
%To be able to improve performance it requires better understanding performance
%deficiencies. To optimize a \JS virtual machine a configurable and realistic
%benchmarking of memory management is needed. Realistic benchmarking is only
%possible if typical \JS heaps are known. This requires intensive analysis of
%\JS heaps of real-world applications.

%We propose our analysis results of \JS heaps of real-world applications. Our
%analysis results support developer to implement realistic benchmarking suites
%which are able to simulate realistic \JS heap behavior. We study 11 popular
%real-world web applications. Depending on the analyzed application we executed
%different user interactions. We use a sampling mechanism to generate a snapshot
%of the current \JS heap at periodic intervals. We analyze these snapshots about
%structure and distributions of object properties.

%This thesis present an analysis of popular and \JS-intensive real-world web
%applications to obtain realistic distributions of object properties and heap
%structure properties.

	% We present our tool chain to obtain a realistic \JS heap model. We also 	present our analysis results of \JS heaps of real-world web applications. 	These analysis results can be used as base for implementing benchmarks which are able
	% to simulate a realistic \JS heap behavior. Furthermore, we illustrate the
	% overhead of Google's virtual machine, V8. We analyze the overhead of the V8
	% separate and present the distributions of system objects and distinguish by
	% types. At the end we compare system objects with mutator objects for better
	% illustration of the overhead.
