### Abstract
	JavaScript performance is a hot topic for pushing the boundaries of web
    applications. Today, browser vendors compare to each other mainly on JavaScript
    benchmark scores rather than other web browsing features. However, recent
    studies[1] suggest that popular benchmarking suites do not
    reflect the behavior of real web applications. We present an extensive
    analysis of JavaScript heaps in 11 real-world web applications to aid the
    development of more realistic workloads for benchmarking the memory
    management of JavaScript virtual machines. In this thesis, we confirm empirical
    results on object type and object lifetime distribution[1]
    and contribute new insights on object size distribution as well as heap
    structure properties.
